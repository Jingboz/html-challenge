# html-challenge
This repository is for Module 11 challenge Data Collection. This challenge includes two parts, "Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News" and "Scrape and Analyse Mars Weather Data". part_1_mars_news.ipynb is the main script for part one. In this part, the web scraping skill is practised by using Beautiful Soup, and the sample web is Mars news site: https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html. In the second part, the skill of scraping HTML table is performed through Beautiful Soup instead of Pandas read_html function. Mars Temperature Data Site: https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html is examed and scraped into a data frame for further analysis in Jupyter Notebook. After the analysis, the following questions are answered 

How many months exist on Mars?
How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)?
Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars?
About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year?
